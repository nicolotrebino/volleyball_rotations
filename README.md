# Volleyball 5-1 Rotation System

This project is a modified version of the **[VBRotations](https://github.com/monkeysppp/VBRotations)** created by [Andy Edwards](https://github.com/monkeysppp/), where I translated the content into Italian and made visual adjustments to better represent the positions on a volleyball court in a 5-1 rotation system with a single setter, including the libero in all game situations.

The project was created for fun, specifically for the volleyball team I play for, but I hope it can be useful for other volleyball enthusiasts and teams who want to visualize and understand the 5-1 rotation system.
